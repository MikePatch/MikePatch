# 👋 Hello! Nice to see you 😊

### I'm Michał and I'm *front-end* lover. 🙌

I've been passionate about creating websites since I can remember 😃. \
Already at school, it was my hobby 👨‍🎓 – so my dream job is to create and work in this profession 💻🛠️.

Currently, I have focused on serious learning  front-end development 🚀.\
My programming mentor 👨‍🏫 – [@devmentor.pl](https://github.com/devmentor-pl) – supports me on my path to **beautifying** the front-end world.
